## Adding policies to your Golang App with Open Policy Agent

It might feel like chasing a rabbit to keep up with usersâ€™ requests for new configurations and policies. It is even more challenging if you build for power users. In the talk, I will show how to use the Open Policy Agent (OPA) for these scenarios, share our experience in Spacelift, and present how to integrate OPA into your Golang application.
